In python, three types of scalar objects
-int (integers)
-float (floating point numbers)
-bool (Boolean operators)

note - when doing division, if you have two integers, the
'/' operator will give an integer with no remainder. to get
remainder, use % sign. 
** is power (i**j = i to the power j)

when doing comparisons, == here means 'is it equal to', so 
answer is a boolean operator
eg 3==3 is TRUE
we can do operators on booleans like so:
a and b 
this returns True if both a and b are true
not a
this returns True if a is false

can convert floats and ints: 
int(3.0) is 3
float(3) is 3.0

you can multiply strings!
3*'a' gives you 'aaa'
'a' + 'b' gives you 'ab'
'a'+str(123) gives you 'a123'
to ask length of strings - len('abc') gives 3
can use indexing in strings - 'abc'[0] is 'a'
it can also count backwards - 'abc'[-1] is 'c'
slicing can be used to get out substrings: 'abc'[1:3] gives 'bc'

raw_input function waits for user input
eg name=raw_input('Enter your name:')
then if you type "Raga", every time you type "name" you'll get "Raga"

If, else conditional operations with COLON in python, and since there are no brackets,
indentations matter, they're not just aesthetic!
eg
x=raw_input('Pick and integer:')
if x%2==0: #if remainder of x/2 is 0
    print('')
    print('Even')
else:
    print('')
    print('Odd')
print('Done with conditional')
