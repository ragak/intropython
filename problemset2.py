#Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only 
#pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

#balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
#annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal
#monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

#For each month:
#Compute the monthly payment, based on the previous monthâ€™s balance.
#Update the outstanding balance by removing the payment, then charging interest on the result.
#Output the month, the minimum monthly payment and the remaining balance.
#Keep track of the total amount of paid over all the past months so far.
#Print out the result statement with the total amount paid and the remaining balance.
#Use these ideas to guide the creation of your code.
